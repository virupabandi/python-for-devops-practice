# Github-JIRA intergration Project - (Part-2)
# lets write the algorithm 1st as mentioned below

# understand what is an API
# convert the python script to API
# Deploy the application to the server
# setup a github webhook
# Conditionally we have to handle it.

# we are going to write the flask framework(example ticket booking app)
# POST: login to the app
# GET: Date and details 
# PUT: Modifying the ticket details.
# DELETE: delete if you do not want the tickets.

# same pattern will apply for all programs
