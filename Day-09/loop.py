for i in range(10):   # here 'i' is variable and we can use any variable. 'in' key word and range and for also keyword. for for loop we have to use sequence (range)
    print (i)
    print("virupaksha")
    print("bandi")

# now execute python loop.py 

# Here sequence can be range, list, tuple, lets try for list now
    
colors = ["yellow", "green", "blue"]
for x in colors:
    print(x)

# now execute python loop.py     


# how you write syntax: for (is key word)     variable     in (keyword) sequence or range/list/tuple
